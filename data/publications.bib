    abstract = {We study the safety verification problem for parameterized systems under the release-acquire (RA) semantics. In the non-parameterized setting, access to atomic compare-and-swap (CAS) instructions renders the safety verification problem undecidable. In the light of this result, we consider parameterized systems consisting of an unbounded number of environment threads executing identical but CAS-free programs combined with a fixed number of distinguished threads that are unrestricted. Our first contribution is an effective and simplified RA semantics for such systems. We leverage the simplified semantics to show that safety verification becomes PSPACE in the parameterized case, an optimistic result for algorithmic verification. Our proof uses an encoding to Datalog which, in addition to the complexity upper bound, suggests a verification algorithm based on Horn clause solvers. We also provide a matching lower bound showing that safety verification is PSPACE-hard.},
